# Salmonella Manuscript

This Github Page details scripts supporting the data analysis for a manuscript on Salmonella strains isolated from Humans and Silver Gulls titled:

Coincident clinical and wildlife populations share *Salmonella enterica* core genomes, with source-specific resistomes

Files generated by the pipelord pipeline are available in the `analysis` directory, delimited files used as inputs are available in the `delims` directory.

To generate Figures 1 and 5, open `Figure_generation.Rmd` and run it. The figures are shown at the bottom of the Rmarkdown document.

See [www.github.com/maxlcummins/pipelord](www.github.com/maxlcummins/pipelord) for more information about the pipeline utilised.
